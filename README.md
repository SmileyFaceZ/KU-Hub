# KU-Hub

KU-Hub is a **community platform** that allows users to **share** summary sheets, 
**review** the subject, share **tricks** or even join a **group** to list of work. 

The application is intended for **KU students** who want to gain more knowledge regarding both 
their fields of study and others such as learn new study tricks 
from other students. 

Our developers decided to choose this topic because we want 
to help KU students who are struggling with studying and feeling burnt out by giving 
a public space for them to share their knowledge and gain some new knowledge, too. 

We hope that our application will help those KU students in need of assistance more or less.

## Background

Studying at the university level is one of the most important steps of life for a lot of 
people and for someone who is not good at adjusting to new environments, 
studying at the University can be very difficult. 

After studying for 3 semesters we found out that having good friends has a huge impact on university life so we decided 
to create a community-based web application focusing on sharing knowledge and tricks for 
studying for each other to help those students needing assistance with some topics 
(e.g how to get better grades/ what to do when youâ€™re burned out).
